# Stardust Player
(JoJo reference)
A video player element for the web that looks nice :)

Currently only the src attribute and the UI are present, but I'm planning to add some more things soon

edit: subtitles are here!<br>
Also btw on the fly preview frames are now generated! I think they're cool so I wanted to mention them :) (edit: I just discovered they don't work on Chrome :( )<br>
edit 2: initial mobile support is here!
