# g-player
A video player element for the web that looks nice :)

Currently only the src attribute and the UI are present, but I'm planning to add some more things soon

edit: subtitles are here!<br>
Also btw on the fly preview frames are now generated! they took a while to implement so I wanted to mention them :)
